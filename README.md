# Topological-Linear-Autoencoders

A short note on the topological perspective of loss landscape of linear autoencoders, alongside parallels with classical PCA. Code is largely taken from https://github.com/danielkunin/Regularized-Linear-Autoencoders, with additional invesigations carried out on alternative data.
